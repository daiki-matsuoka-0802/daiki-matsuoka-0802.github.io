I work in the field of **formal semantics** of natural language.
In other words, I aim to develop a mathematical model that explains humans' cognitive ability to compute the meaning of natural language expressions.

More concretely, my research focuses on the following topics.

- **Type-theoretical semantics**
  - Type theory, a formal system developed in computer science, serves as a powerful tool for analyzing meanings.
- **Categorial grammar**
  - In this framework, syntactic structures are build together with meaning representations, providing a computationally plausible model of meaning composition.

I am currently a member of [Yanaka Lab](https://ylab.mystrikingly.com) at the University of Tokyo.

I have [another website (in Japanese)](https://liewecmays.net), where I occasionally post some notes on what I have self-studied (partly as a hobby).
